String Shot,Bug,Status,Lv. 2,Action,Spell save,60 feet,Up to 1 hour,"The user spits out strings of silk. The strings fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The strings are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured. If the strings aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the strings collapse on themselves, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Strings layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. The first time a creature enters the strings on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while in the strings or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained by the strings can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.The strings are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of strings exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire."

Surf,Water,Special,Lv. 8,Action,Spell save,1 mile,"Concentration, up to 6 rounds","The user attacks by swamping a wide area with a giant wave that springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 water damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 water damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends. A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave's force, though, the creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the wall falls to the ground."
Wish,Normal,Status,Lv. 9,Action,Other,Self,Instantaneous,"The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: (1) You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground. (2) You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell. (3) You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent. (4) You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. (5) You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features. (6) You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. (7) You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails. The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 flat damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress."
Teleport,Psychic,Status,Lv. 7,Action,Other,10 feet,Instantaneous,"This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. "
Confusion,Psychic,Special,Lv. 4,Action,Spell save,90 feet,"Concentration, up to 1 minute","Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can’t take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. On a 1, the target doesn’t take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll 1d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, east; 3, south; or 4, west. On a 2-6, the target doesn’t move or take actions. On a 7-8, the target doesn’t move, and it takes the Attack action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach, the target takes no action. On a 9-10, the target chooses its behavior. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success. The Sphere’s radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4."
Moonlight,Fairy,Status,Lv. 5,Action,Other,Self,"Concentration, up to 1 minute","For the duration, moonlight fills a 20-foot Emanation originating from you with Dim Light. While in that area, you and your allies have Half Cover and Resistance to Dark, Electric, Fairy, Fire, Ice, and Psychic damage. While the spell lasts, you can use one of the following options, ending the spell immediately. LIBERATION: When you fail a saving throw to avoid or end the Frightened, Grappled, or Restrained condition, you can take a Reaction to succeed on the save instead. RESPITE: As a Magic action, you or an ally within the area regains Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier."
Thunder,Electric,Special,Lv. 6,Action,Spell save,150 feet,Instantaneous,"A wicked thunderbolt is dropped on a target you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.

Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Electric damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.One additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each spell slot level above 6."
